# Documentation Change Log

## 2026-06-09

- Added documentation control files:
  - `documents/STATUS.md`
  - `documents/LOG.md`
  - `documents/HANDOFF.md`
- Added `documents/features/`.
- Added `documents/features/todo/`.
- Added `documents/features/incomplete/`.
- Moved active todo plans from `documents/todo/` to `documents/features/todo/`.
- Moved incomplete notes from `documents/incomplete/` to `documents/features/incomplete/`.
- Refactored `LlmService` into a facade over provider config, client runtime, model catalog, and health-check services.
- Restored and updated `documents/architecture-diagram.md` with the new LLM internal service split.
- Moved completed LLM service refactor plan to `documents/done/llm-service-refactor-plan.md`.
- Identified `gen-ui-spec.constant.ts` as a candidate for cleanup because the base GenUI prompt and endpoint-specific hints are becoming inconsistent and repetitive.
